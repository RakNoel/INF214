# INF214
Repo for the assignments in INF214

### Task 1:
#### Getting stuff to work:
It was a real hassle getting everything up and running. I'm using Archlinux so setting upp an IDE i could not
really be bothered with VisualStudio as it is HUGE, slow and overpowered. But I did not wish to use Vim and gcc either.

I eventually went with CLion from my favorite IDE-makers JetBrains as we do get a free student license. This comes
pre-installed with CMake, which was a hassle of its own to get compiling. But after just two hours i finally had myself
a "Hello World!" program.

Now getting C++ to work was not an easy task. Getting everything given for this assigneent to run? please don't even
get me started. I have never used this language ever, and apparently this offers a LOT of freedom for the developer
but with NO SUPPORT what so ever. Apparently this is top down compiled, so you cannot have the main method at the start.

#### First run:
You can apparently freely mess arround with pointers, deconstructors and god knows what. I have NO clue what all this
code does, and googeling gives me a headace. Anyways continuing on. After much back and fourth, I finally made it:
```
/home/raknoel/CLionProjects/INF214/src/cmake-build-debug/INF214
3412

Process finished with exit code 0
``` 

### Task 2:
Beginning
